    <p class="about-text">Ivan Alexander Zapata is a student at Howard Community College studying to receive a degree in audio-video media production (AVMP). Ivan has been interested in media ever since he could remember, whether it was related to animations, shows, films, etc. He would record skits and other types of entertainment videos and would upload them onto YouTube when he was younger. When he was in high school he continued this interest by joining a TV production class as well as entering multiple film contests, one of which he would win third place alongside his team. While in college, he would also be a part of a photography business, helping capture photos as well as coming up with unique concepts and designs for shoots.</p>
    <p class="about-text">Ivan’s passion for media creation stems from years of admiring different works of art. He realized that the content he would observe brought so much joy to him and others. So he wishes to create as well to make people feel the same. His one goal in life is to make others feel happy, even if it wasn’t in film he would work hard no matter what to accomplish this goal.</p>
